# Control_myCobot_6DOF_Robot_Arm
This project presents the keyboard buttons control of a 6-degree-of-freedom MYCobot robotic arm, showcasing its advanced intelligent route planning capabilities. The project aim involves showcasing the armâ€™s autonomous control through specific poses triggered by dedicated keyboard buttons. Operationalizing these commands, the robotic arm seamlessly executes movements, autonomously navigating to reach the predetermined poses. Each button corresponds to a unique pose, prompting immediate movement upon activation. Furthermore, leveraging RVIZ2 facilitates the integration of the myCobot GUI interface, streamlining the configuration of individual poses programmed through these buttons.


# Components needed 
1. MyCobot robotic arm
2. Desktop computer, Keyboard, HDMI cable.

# Installation and Setup
The myCobot is connected to the power supply which turns on the robot arm. HDMI, Mouse, and keyboard cables connect to the robot arm which enables the robot setup process to be seamless. A built-in Ubuntu 18.04 Mate Linux imager is installed into the robot raspberry pi which serves as the desktop operating system for the myCobot 280pi robot arm. Setup, updates and all ROS2 packages installation is perform. The installing time for setting up the robot is approximately 8 hours long.
