# Control_myCobot_6DOF_Robot_Arm
This project presents the keyboard buttons control of a 6-degree-of-freedom MYCobot robotic arm, showcasing its advanced intelligent route planning capabilities. The project aim involves showcasing the armâ€™s autonomous control through specific poses triggered by dedicated keyboard buttons. Operationalizing these commands, the robotic arm seamlessly executes movements, autonomously navigating to reach the predetermined poses. Each button corresponds to a unique pose, prompting immediate movement upon activation. Furthermore, leveraging RVIZ2 facilitates the integration of the myCobot GUI interface, streamlining the configuration of individual poses programmed through these buttons.
